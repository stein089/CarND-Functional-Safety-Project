# Functional Safety Project: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This repository contains my implementation of the Functional Safety Project (Term 3 - Project 2) in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program.

### Goals

The goal of this project is to create functional safety documents. These documents are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. A safety case is a collection of documents proving that a project has made a vehicle safer.


### Submission Files

The repo contains a PDF file called **Project_Instructions.pdf**, a `Template_Files` folder and an `Architecture_Diagrams` folder containing visuals needed to complete the reports. This information was used as a starting point to develop the solution.

The folder `Submission_Files` contains the completed documents as pdf files:
* 01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.pdf

* 02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.pdf

* 03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf

* 04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf

* 05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.pdf
